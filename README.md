###  PROBLEM OVERVIEW AND PROBLEM ANALYSIS
##     PROBLEM OVERVIEW
       A retail shop requires a interface for the employees that record their staffâ€™s attendance and allow the system to make ROTA for the employees. A python program needs to be designed that not only manages the presence record of the employees but also decides their 
       shift timings respective of their contracts and availability times.
###    PROBLEM SOLVING STRATEGIES
       To solve this problem, I need some set of functions that records the attendance of employees, makes shift patterns and also give access to users for availing employee benefits.
##     RECORDING ATTENDANCE OF EMPLOYEES.
       A function needs to be initiated that records the attendance of the employees when the feed it using the user interface using their login credentials. The functions also add their attendance to the system and maintains a proper record for their presence.
##     SHIFT ALLOTMENT.
       A python code needs to be implemented that arranges shift patterns for the employees while considering the contract hours and the availability of the employees which was discussed prior to the employment.
##     EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.
       Another program needs to be activated that helps the employees to get some employee discount or any other benefits from the company at other outlets at other locations. Also, this part will tell the employee about their insurance status and their paid leaves count.
